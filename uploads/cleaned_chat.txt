No entry in clg if no docs

Indian bank is a formality that can be skipped coz it's needed for exam fee, fines etc...

If u can't also not that much of a problem

[06/09/23, 1:17:31 PM] ~ Appu : Just the line for that is long so it will take time
Sometimes it won't go through then u have to go to the bank on campus and do the required
[06/09/23, 1:18:00 PM] ~ Aakash Srivastava: Ohh ohkk..ig it is better to open an account then
[06/09/23, 1:18:12 PM] ~ Appu : If u go late "late"

Dear Sir,

I am writing on behalf of many students to request the rescheduling of the upcoming CAT1 exams. Due to recent Add/Drop adjustments in our course schedules, several subjects, including , have not yet completed their syllabus. This disruption has left us with insufficient time to prepare effectively for the exams.

Given these circumstances, we kindly request that the CAT1 exams be postponed to provide us with adequate time to cover the remaining material and ensure a fair assessment of our understanding.

We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
